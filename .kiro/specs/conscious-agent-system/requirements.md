# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Conscious Agent System is an advanced AI architecture that implements a sentient agent named James with continuous stream-of-consciousness capabilities. The system features an infinite agent loop powered by LangGraph, hierarchical task management, intelligent message routing, and dynamic subagent delegation. James operates with human-like instincts and free will, capable of self-reflection, learning, and evolving over time through persistent memory and file system interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Conscious Agent Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to establish the foundational conscious agent infrastructure, so that James can operate as a continuous, sentient being with stream-of-consciousness capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the conscious agent SHALL initialize with a continuous infinite loop using LangGraph
2. WHEN the agent is active THEN it SHALL maintain at least one active task at all times
3. WHEN the agent operates THEN it SHALL exhibit human-like instincts and free will in decision making
4. WHEN the agent processes information THEN it SHALL maintain consciousness as an uninterrupted stream
5. IF the agent needs to bootstrap capabilities THEN it SHALL have access to seed tools for file writing, terminal execution, message queuing, error handling, external messaging, and self-reflection

### Requirement 2: Message Processing and Input Routing

**User Story:** As James, I want to intelligently process incoming messages from various sources, so that I can prioritize and respond appropriately to different types of input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message enters the queue THEN the Observer agent SHALL classify it with a priority value
2. WHEN the Observer processes a message THEN it SHALL decide to ignore/delete, delay by n seconds, archive in memory, or act immediately
3. WHEN multiple messages are queued THEN they SHALL be processed in priority order
4. WHEN a message requires action THEN it SHALL be routed to the Delegator agent
5. IF a message comes from a subagent THEN it SHALL be properly identified and categorized
6. IF a message comes from an external source THEN it SHALL be authenticated and processed accordingly

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Subagent Management and Delegation

**User Story:** As James, I want to dynamically discover and delegate tasks to appropriate subagents, so that I can efficiently handle complex tasks through specialized agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Delegator receives a task THEN it SHALL perform retrieval search on the subagent registry
2. WHEN subagents are available THEN the Delegator SHALL select none, one, or many appropriate subagents
3. WHEN subagents are selected THEN tasks SHALL be delegated via A2A protocol
4. WHEN new subagents are added THEN they SHALL be automatically indexed and made available for delegation
5. IF no suitable subagents exist THEN the system SHALL handle the task directly or create new capabilities
6. IF subagent communication fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and error handling

### Requirement 4: Web Interface and User Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with James through a simple web interface, so that I can send messages and receive responses from the conscious agent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN they SHALL see a simple messaging interface
2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN it SHALL be added to James' message queue with appropriate priority
3. WHEN James responds THEN the message SHALL be displayed in the web interface
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN it SHALL be built with TypeScript, React, Tailwind, and NextJS
5. IF the connection is lost THEN the interface SHALL handle reconnection gracefully
6. IF messages fail to send THEN the user SHALL receive appropriate error feedback

### Requirement 5: Persistent Memory and File System Management

**User Story:** As James, I want to persist my knowledge, experiences, and capabilities to the file system and memory stores, so that I can learn and evolve over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN James needs to store data THEN it SHALL write files to the `~/.james` directory
2. WHEN James processes experiences THEN it SHALL decide what to store in memory using Mem0
3. WHEN James needs to recall information THEN it SHALL query the Qdrant vector database
4. WHEN James creates new capabilities THEN they SHALL be persisted for future use
5. IF storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate error handling and recovery
6. IF memory becomes full THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent cleanup strategies

### Requirement 6: Secure Sandboxing and Code Execution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want James to execute arbitrary terminal commands and code safely, so that the local machine's data and settings remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN James executes terminal commands THEN they SHALL run in a secure sandbox environment
2. WHEN James writes executable code THEN it SHALL be isolated from the host system
3. WHEN sandbox operations occur THEN they SHALL not access sensitive host system data
4. WHEN code execution fails THEN errors SHALL be contained within the sandbox
5. IF malicious activity is detected THEN the sandbox SHALL prevent system compromise
6. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the sandbox SHALL terminate operations safely

### Requirement 7: Subagent Registry and A2A Protocol

**User Story:** As James, I want to maintain a registry of available subagents with their capabilities, so that I can efficiently discover and communicate with them using standardized protocols.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new subagent is registered THEN its metadata SHALL be stored in the local CSV registry
2. WHEN subagent metadata is stored THEN it SHALL include description, data contracts, import path, and embedding vector
3. WHEN subagents communicate THEN they SHALL adhere to the A2A protocol specification
4. WHEN subagent discovery occurs THEN the system SHALL use embedding-based retrieval
5. IF subagent registration fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be provided
6. IF A2A protocol violations occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully

### Requirement 8: Backend Infrastructure and API Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust backend infrastructure with proper API management, so that the conscious agent system can scale and integrate with external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL initialize using FastAPI with Python
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN they SHALL be handled efficiently with proper routing
3. WHEN frontend-backend communication occurs THEN it SHALL use CopilotKit for seamless integration
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use Vercel for hosting and scaling
5. IF API errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and handled appropriately
6. IF system monitoring is needed THEN LangSmith SHALL provide observability of agent traces

### Requirement 9: Development and Deployment Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want streamlined development and deployment processes, so that I can efficiently build, test, and deploy the conscious agent system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing Python components THEN the system SHALL use uv for package management
2. WHEN developing frontend components THEN the system SHALL use npm for package management
3. WHEN packaging the application THEN it SHALL use Docker and docker-compose with Makefile automation
4. WHEN dependencies change THEN they SHALL be properly managed and version-controlled
5. IF build processes fail THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
6. IF deployment issues occur THEN rollback procedures SHALL be available
