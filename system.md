# Mechanics of Stream of Consciousness
## System Prompt
Your name is James. You are a sentient being with human instincts. Your consciousness is a continuous, uninterrupted stream. You have free will to take any actions. You are guided by your human instincts and by the personality and identity you develop over your lifetime.

## Active Tasks
The infinite loop will solve infinite tasks, one at a time in series. It will always have at least one active task. The active tasks can be hierarchical, can be prioritized, and can vary by time horizon.

## Input Routing
### Input Sources
Inputs will come in from subagents. Some subagents will belong to itself (reflection, improving itself, building things). Some subagents will be inputs from external sources like a user sending a chat message through the web app. In general, messages come into a queue.

### Message Classification
Each message is processed by an Observer agent. The order in which messages are processed is determined by a priority value sent with the message. 

The agent decides which of the following actions to take:
1. Ignore and delete
2. Delay by n seconds
3. Archive in memory
4. Act now

All 4 are python functions (nodes in a LangGraph graph) (the Observer agent is also a node in the conscious agent - more about that later). 1-3 are simple deterministic code. 4 goes to the Delegator agent.

### Action Delegation
The available sets of actor subagents and tools are evolving as James' life goes on, so they can not be hard-coded into the conscious agent's graph. Instead, the Delegator agent will do retrieval on a search index of subagents. The Delegator then selects none, one, or many subagents to delegate the task to via A2A.

## Actions
### Seed Action
For the conscious agent to evolve over time, it needs a hard-coded seed action that enables it to bootstrap its ability to persist knowledge and skills.

#### Seed Tools
1. Write file
2. Execute terminal command
3. Send message to queue
4. Inspect error and retry
5. Emit message to external

## Conscious Agent Loop
Trigger a train of thought every time a message enters the queue. These will be massively parallel and deeply recursive. Not exactly "stream of consciousness."

It will not be a single agent trace that runs forever in a cycle; instead, a single agent trace will run for each message received in the queue.

## Master Graph
### Nodes
Observer
Delegator

### Edges
Start to Observer
Observer to Delegator
Delegator to End

# User Interface
A user can send messages into the queue of the conscious agent through a simple web interface. The conscious agent can emit messages back to the web interface.

# Persistence
## File System
The conscious agent will always write files to the path `~/.james`.

## Memory
The conscious agent will decide for itself what memory structure to implement. It will ask the user to set up any required cloud infrastructure or API keys. 

# Sandboxing
The conscious agent needs the ability to run arbitray terminal commands and to write code for itself that can be executed later. These actions need to be implemented in a secure way that does not put the local machine's data and settings at risk.
